## [unreleased]

### Added

- An option to toggle follow mode on/off has been added.
  This is a breaking change, because it modifies the default behavior of the library
  where follow mode was the default.

- An option to specify the last number of bytes only has been added, similar to
  the `-c` / `--bytes` flag of the tail command.
